# LeetCode-SQL50 Challenge
*A comprehensive journey through SQL problem-solving.*

**Introduction:**

I've embarked on the LeetCode SQL50 challenge to enhance my SQL skills and explore a wide range of SQL concepts. This challenge covers topics like basic selects, joins, aggregate functions, sorting, grouping, advanced selects, subqueries, and string functions.

**Key Learnings**

So far, I've gained a solid understanding of basic SQL syntax, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, Operators and ORDER BY clauses. 

**Future Goals:**

I plan to continue working through the SQL50 challenge and focus on more advanced topics like subqueries and string functions. I'm also interested in learning about performance optimization techniques.

**Acknowledgements:**

I would like to thank the LeetCode community for providing valuable resources and discussions.
