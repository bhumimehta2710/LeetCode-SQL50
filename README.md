# LeetCode-SQL50 Challenge
*A comprehensive journey through SQL problem-solving.*

**Introduction:**

I've embarked on the LeetCode SQL50 challenge to enhance my SQL skills and explore a wide range of SQL concepts. This challenge covers topics like basic selects, joins, aggregate functions, sorting, grouping, advanced selects, subqueries, and string functions.

**Status** : Inprogress

**Key Learnings**

So far, I've gained a solid understanding of basic SQL syntax, including SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses. I've also learned how to use aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

**Future Goals:**

I plan to continue working through the SQL50 challenge and focus on more advanced topics like subqueries and string functions. I'm also interested in learning about performance optimization techniques.

**Acknowledgements:**

I would like to thank the LeetCode community for providing valuable resources and discussions.
