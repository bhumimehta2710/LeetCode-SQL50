SELECT DISTINCT (author_id) AS id 
FROM Views 
WHERE author_id=viewer_id 
ORDER BY id ASC;

-- To identify authors who have viewed their own articles, I filtered the 'Views' table using the condition that 'author_id=viewer_id'. 
-- To eliminate duplicates, I have used the 'DISTINCT' keyword, and then sorted the results in ascending order using 'ORDER BY'.
